INSIGHTS

•	Customers typically order about 2 to 3 pizzas per order, and the average revenue per order is healthy at $38, which is good for a pizza business.

•	The restaurant should focus staffing and ingredient preparation around these peak times, especially during lunch (12-1 PM) and evening (4-8 PM).

•	Medium pizzas are the most popular. Marketing and promotions should target this size. Supreme pizzas are the best-selling category overall, indicating customer preference toward premium toppings.

•	Focus efforts to promote underperforming pizzas (especially Brie Carre) or reconsider whether to keep them on the menu.

•	Plan staffing levels and inventory purchases accordingly to reduce wastage and optimize costs.

CONCLUSION

•	This pizza sales analysis project provided valuable insights into customer ordering behavior, sales performance, and product preferences.

•	Key findings show that Barbecue Chicken and Supreme pizzas, especially in Medium size, drive most of the revenue, while orders peak around lunch and evening hours on Fridays and Saturdays.

•	By aligning inventory, staffing, and marketing strategies with these patterns, the business can improve efficiency and boost sales.

•	Additionally, underperforming pizzas like Brie Carre should be reviewed for removal or improvement.

•	Overall, this data-driven approach helps in making informed decisions to maximize profitability and customer satisfaction.
